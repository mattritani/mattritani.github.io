      I really enjoy the word Vociferousness and I think the idea of a Tao Jones index is very funny. I really identify with seeking to make others happy. I think that hosting is one of my favourite things to do. To host and to feed people and to make people feel relaxed and happy.

      I do feel somewhat conflicted that a lot of these practices are appropriated by companies that sit at the top of the western liberalist framework. Other cultures originate this type of thinking. The need for stress release in the workplace comes from a toxic capitalist labour model. I also think itâ€™s a highly individualist model. I would also challenge profit and progress are universals goals for people.

    I can see the logic in the accurate perception and strategic use of emotions and just understanding how you are doing. Interested in the idea that emotional intelligence is just another effective skill to have in your career. How do we take an objective look at ourselves? Labelling emotions as a practice. I like the idea that intuition is experienced in the body. The practice of being present and seeing things for what they are I think is tough.

      <b> Q2. How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness? </b>
      </style=">

      I found it really hard. I think stopping and doing nothing when I am trying to do a lot is hard. My mind just raced. I think I will need to practice it more. I think structuring mindfulness into my day will be a helpful way of doing this.
