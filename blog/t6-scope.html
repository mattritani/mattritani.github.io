Explain to a non-tech friend what 'scope' is, and how it works in JavaScript?
        </p>

        <p>
          Scope is the field of influence a certain part of a program has - Maybe think about if the program was a city. Some parts of the program will control the whole city, like a law that people aren’t allowed to commit arson. This applies to everyone in the city and they are aware of this rule and have to comply with it. If you then next think of a suburb or special housing area - this suburb might have a rule that you have to paint your house in certain colours. The people of the suburb would have to paint their houses in the right colors - but not everyone in the whole city would - It would be a local rule. If you then move to a household in the suburb it too might have some rules - like don’t wear shoes inside. If you lived in the house you would have to take off your shoes - but not everyone in the suburb or the whole city would have to take their shoes off in the house. This structure of specificness and applicability are levels from global (whole of program) - to local scope.
