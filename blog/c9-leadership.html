I have generally experienced good leadership. Compassionate to an extent if different ways. I’ve had leaders that I think have a set of values or things that they do to ensure that they can be relied upon which I think is important to build trust. People are people before they are employees.

Multiplying goodness meditation I found helpful - there are certain times of the day that I do this and I think it helps me. My walk to and from work is meditative and I think I do try to perceive myself more and more authentically. Not propping myself up or pulling myself down but seeing myself and my mind and being ok with that.

          Tonglen I didn’t do very well but I appreciated the metaphors and if felt like a method were people were trying to be be more with the world. I think this in some ways an indigenous perspective.

Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, Fairness. Status I think I value in certain forms. I think it might not be too productive to take through bootcamp. Certainty I’m not bothered about - I thrive in a messy situation. Autonomy I value and in some aspects I am stubborn headly independent. I have a taurus ascendant. Relatedness I think always needs to be approached with intersectionality in mind and I think there are always shared frames of reference between the most different groups of people and it’s important to seek these out. Fairness and justice is very important to me as a Libra. Injustice and inequality makes me very frustrated and angry and I want to change it.

I have difficult conversations quite often but I want to improve my ability to work through them. I think starting from a place of self awareness and kindness is a good place to start.
