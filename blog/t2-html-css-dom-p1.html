            Q1. Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?<b>
    </p>
    <p><p class ="body">
            Coming from an architecture background the house analogy is one I find quite relatable.<b>
            <em>HTML</em> is the overall structure of the website/house. For instance when you arrive at house the homepage might be the foyer. From the homepage you might have a menu bar which is analogous to the hall way or circulation around the house. Different rooms/pages will have different sizes and performance requirements that is dependent on what you need.
            <em>CSS</em> is what we might call the look and feel. In the house/website what is the carpet/font is it wool/shag pile/storm colored. So CSS allows you to go into detail into what the stuff looks like.
            <em>DOM</em> I find more complex - I feel like it is the thing that is interpreting the HTML and making it happen - So a foundation, a design or even a contractor who is constantly building the house is a good analogy.<b>

            Q2. What is meant by boxifying design?<b>
    </p>
    <p><p class ="body">
            Boxifying the design is a process breaking down a design to its smallest constituent parts so that can be built using html elements.<b>

            Q3. What is the box model?<b>
    </p>
    <p><p class ="body">
            The box model is the amount of space an element might take up. There is a margin, border, padding and then the actual content. You can adjust all of these parts to ensure that content displays as you would like it to.<b>
