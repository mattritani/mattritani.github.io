                Q1. Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?
        </style=">

        </p>
        <p><p>
                Coming from an architecture background the house analogy is one I find quite relatable.
                <br><em>HTML</em> is the overall structure of the website/house. For instance when you arrive at house the homepage might be the foyer. From the homepage you might have a menu bar which is analogous to the hall way or circulation around the house. Different rooms/pages will have different sizes and performance requirements that is dependent on what you need.
                <br><em>CSS</em> is what we might call the look and feel. In the house/website what is the carpet/font is it wool/shag pile/storm colored. So CSS allows you to go into detail into what the stuff looks like.
                <br><em>DOM</em> I find more complex - I feel like it is the thing that is interpreting the HTML and making it happen - So a foundation, a design or even a contractor who is constantly building the house is a good analogy.

              Q2. What is Boxfying Design?
      </style=">

        </p>
        <p><p>
                Boxifying the design is a process breaking down a design to its smallest constituent parts so that can be built using html elements.
        </p>

        <p>
          <style=" font-weight:="" bold;="" "="" style="
        font-weight: bold;
      ">
                Q3. What is the box model?
        </style=">
        </p>

        <p><p>
                The box model is the amount of space an element might take up. There is a margin, border, padding and then the actual content. You can adjust all of these parts to ensure that content displays as you would like it to.
