          As if talking to a non-tech friend, discuss:
        </p>

        <p>
          Q1. How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?
        </p>

        <p>
          Javascript I find more complex than HTML and CSS. It is quite easy to see the connection between the written code in CSS and HTML and what appears on screen. Javascript is more complex. Javascript  ‘does the stuff’ of the website. t can assess things, make things happen and link different stuff in the Javascript. It can also alter the HTML  and CSS. Returning to the existing House analogy  Javascript is appliances of the house. Javascript does things. Light switches turn on and off and the oven creates heat. These actions are performed under very specific conditions. The same goes for javascript.

        <p>
          Q2. Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'brushing your teeth'?
        </p>

        <p>
          The basis of control flow is that program essentially functions in a linear fashion. The program begins at the top of the page and runs through and executes the code chronologically. However our experiences with the digital environment are rarely linear. As such, we need to be able to provide a variety of different user paths through the program. This is where loops come in handy. Loops iterate through the code within a loop until a certain set of condition are met. This is helpful when doing repetitive tasks that have a defined scope. A good example is iterating through an array  identifying values containing a specific letter. You could code this individual for each word but it is faster for a loop to do it for the whole array.  An example of a loop in everyday life might be like eating cereal. You might have a cupboard and in that cupboard is a shelf. On that shelf there might be a variety of breakfast cereals. However you might have a friend staying over that has a nut allergy. A loop could be used to iterate through the cereals to identify if any of them did not have nut products in their mix. The loop could iterate a test “n” times where “n” is equal to the the amount of different cereals.
        </p>

        <p>
          Q3. Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects?
        </p>

        <p>
          Arrays are sets of values, Objects are kind of like sets of associated values. So an array might be red ,  blue , yellow  whereas and object might be Flower object; colour : 'red' , smell : 'fragrant' etc...  So an object contains key - value pairs whereas is an array is a whole set of values. When you are accessing an array you might access it based on its position in the array 0,1,2. . With an object you can use the key of the key value pair to access the properties assigned within that object.
        </p>

        <p>
          Q4. Explain what functions are and why they are useful?
        </p>

        <p>
          A function is a process in javascript that is contained within a word that you can use later to call a function. They are a block of code that takes in values (arguments?) that can be then manipulated through the code in the function. They are helpful because you can write all the functions that you will need at the start of your code. Later on you can call the function again to fit compactly into you code.
