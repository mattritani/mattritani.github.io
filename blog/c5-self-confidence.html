        Read or watch chapter 4 of Search Inside Yourself, and reflect:
        </p>

        <p>
        Q1. What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?
        </p>

        <p>
          Mindfulness I think facilitates self awareness. It opens up an opportunity for introspection as you are not engaging with the milieu of data floating around. Without this noise you can review the more deep and meaningful aspects of self. One has a pause to take out their emotional skeletons, try them on, wear them, dance around the room and reckon with them. Our deeper emotional states and natural tendencies when we know them well can help us better navigate the world.
        </p>

        <p>
        Q2. Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?
        </p>

        <p>
        I tried mindful journaling. It’s a practice that I have tried to keep up. It allows for more writing and writing that is not necessarily stressed as to weather it is good or not. It is a writing where on can subjectively view the self as if an external narrator. I think this also helps to build an objective empathy - you can observe this person as if they were a friend. As if they were someone we wanted to care for and help.
        </p>

        <p>
        Q3.  What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?
        </p>

        <p>
          I took away that you can be calm in a storm. You are like the ocean, you can be calm or violent. The wind can ripple across your surface and make huge crashing waves. However regardless of the condition or the influences you remain being, inextricably, the ocean. You are you. Regardless of how you are feeling. There is power in having cognizance of this fact.
