Q1 - What are your core values and what do you stand for?
        </p>

        <p>
Life through the pleasure, passion and purpose lens is a way of framing the work that you do.  Pleasures means pursuing the things that feel good in the moment but that might not be a lasting improvement. Passion mean focusing on the things you can do well and executing them well - enjoying what you do and doing it excellently. Purpose is finding a form of labour that aligns with what you believe and working in line with those values. This kind of work brings you closer to self-actualisation. My core values are quite broad. As a Libra justice is really important to me and seeing unfairness and inequality is really disappointing to me. I believe in ethical stewardship of resources. I believe in Manaakitanga. I believe in the role of decolonisation in combating global neoliberalism and its resultant environmental and social effects. I stand for people who are not from advantage and I try in all of my practices to enable people who are in a less privileged position than me. I believe in Mana Wahine in political leadership.

Q2 -  How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?
        </p>

        <p>
I found the resilience ideas and mediation exercise useful. It is interesting that both success and failure have similar bodily stress reactions. As good as it feels to revel in the pleasures of success I think it is a challenge to observe both as emotional phenomena. The self-awareness to perceive your own emotion is an ongoing process. The mediation exercise was difficult in observing my failures and immediately feeling shame and that shame as a harsh but also strong way to prevent a mishap from occurring again. I think for me it is difficult as being hard on myself has served me well in the past so to move to a space of self-kindness and self-empathy is difficult. Having not tried it I am maybe not convinced of it’s efficacy.
