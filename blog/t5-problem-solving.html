Q1. Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you got blocked on a simple problem and when you solved Solved a problem in an elegant way
        </p>

        <p>
The first time I got block on a simple problem I was adding another block of code to a function. I had gone on and updated the rest of the code as I was in a rush and wanted to update the other sections. Big mistake. I went through and updated a later development of my code - which was working fine by the way - however at the time I was getting steadily more and more frustrated trying to address a problem within code that looked completely fine to me. The more frustrated I got, the more anxious I got and the more anxious I got the less effectively I could solve the problem. I actually ended up stopping and going to bed. I slept on it and thought about it away from the the computer for a little while. I came back and step through the exercise and immediately saw the minor error I had made -that I had been in too much of a rush to address at the time had one misnamed variable that meant that my entire program was not working. I learned that I needed to slow down and go through the process properly. I know that I need to give myself space and to take off the pressure in order to solve the problem.
        </p>

        <p>
As for solving a problem in an elegant way  - I’m not sure that I have yet.  I think if anything I have been going through these exercises and looking at how I can use the limited knowledge of code that I have to deliver what I need to in the most easy, chic and effective way. I think this is a combination of not being super over the material and utilising my design background. Ask me this question in a couple of months.

Q2. Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:
        </p>

        <p>
Pseudocode I find helpful verbally - I like talk to myself and try to resolve it that way. Trying something, well I mean you have to something - most of the time it just doesn’t work. Rubber ducky method, similar to the talking pseudocode this is helpful, I want to talk to a Nefertiti because she’s a boss. Reading error messages - still gibberish to me. Console Logging - bit slow better to go through with the chrome developer tools. Googling - Hell yeah definitely my modus operandi. Asking your peers for help - I tend to just stalk the message threads in slack to profit from other people's problems. Asking coaches for help - mostly more helpful for in a pastoral sense. Improving your process with reflection - yes yes yes.
