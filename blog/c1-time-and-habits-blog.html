    <p>
    Q1. Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?<br>
    MEDITATION AND MINDFULNESS - Mediation and mindfulness as self care for the purposes of making your more effective at what you do.<br>


    SMALL VICTORIES - I tried the small victories process - and will continue working on it. The meaningful celebration of small victories is important to do. Not just relying on your innate ability but your ability to build habits that are meaningful in a long term way. Celebrating with integrity and the relationship of this celebration to meaningful self image. Having worth in yourself. There is a difference between; 1. growth that is meaningful to you rather than; 2. performed growth for the approval of others and gives little meaning to you.<br>

    Identifying that all large and impressive things began as small and unimpressive things. Piggybacking new small habits and behaviours onto your existing habits. How do you identify what is meaningful in what you do and pursuing that - It’s your happiness and your life at stake.<br>

    POMODORO - I like Pomodoro as a unit to structure time and also to give you an understanding of how long you think you will take. Self awareness, understanding and empathy for when you are doing good and when to stop.<br>
    THE ZONE - What does the zone looks like for you? Avoid putting pressure on yourself to perform outside a space where you are ‘feeling good’

    Q2. What did you find interesting?<br>

    Time-boxing and then stopping regardless of completion. Then reviewing progress and reassessing what to do next. I would normally just keep charging until i'd done it.<br><br>


    Q3. What worked for you?<br>

    Time-boxing, flow and Pomodoro will be helpful skills and tools for me to use my time. I want to focus on habits/ behaviours and the celebration of small victories. Meditation and mindfulness I will use for self care and mental health. Though they are practices I've struggled to adopt in the past.<br><br>


    Q4. Which will you experiment further with?<br>

    Habits and Behaviours as a means of getting myself to where I want to be. Meditation and Mindfulness will be included in my day to day study. I think being onsite during phase 0 will help. Small victories will be the most helpful to me. It's something I know I'm bad at.<br>
