Q1 - When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?
        </p>

        <p>
The big one for me is when I am not getting through something as quickly as I would like.  It think if something is not working after 3-4 attempts and research I get frustrated as I quickly contextualise this problem and my inability to solve it  within a broad sphere of things I should be doing and things I should be doing well. I get annoyed/stressed and anxious and for me that immediately goes to a negative place about myself - like your not good enough, everyone else has worked harder and is over this, what are you doing your a mess - let's revisit that childhood memory of you singing a phlegmy (on account of eating a whole bar of dairy chocolate immediately beforehand ) Wyclef Jean cover in front of a good two-thirds of your intermediate school - that was really cringe lets just sit here with that memory to exacerbate you feeling bad. Which is weird. Especially when I have been in more challenging situations before - I’ve gotten myself out of hairier places and yet I don’t seem to bring the empercial confidence in my ability to overcome something through to the next learning. I think I believe in myself theoretically but not fundamentally.

Q2 - How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?
        </p>

        <p>
I found it helpful. It’s hard to like bring yourself back to the room that you are sitting in and  when you are really busy and thinking about a lot of stuff you can easily lose touch with reality and start having really unproductive thoughts. Exercises that remind that the sun will rise tomorrow and most people are largely 1. unaware  and 2. Uninterested in the arbritrary and high expectations I set for myself. The mindful practices in the body are HARD. Like 10 minutes sitting still - especially when I have so much to do is a NIGHTMARE. Hopefully I get better. Ask me next week.
