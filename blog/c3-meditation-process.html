        Q1. How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?
        </p>

        <p>
        The process over ‘process over product’ concept assisted and helped how I dealt with the site redesign and rebuild. I was aware about spending my time focussed on learning. I wanted to avoid getting stuck in a difficult spot and banging my head against the wall where I wouldn't learn. For me a key goal was getting my head more around how CSS grids and Layouts work. I focused on that in the context of wanting to achieve a certain website design.
        </p>

        <p>
        Q2. What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?
        </p>

        <p>
        I thought that it was something useful and helpful to my life but also something that I ‘will do later’ and ‘will do when I have time.’
        It is not something I’ve ever been that good at or had the kind habits of structure to accommodate.
       </p>

        <p>
        Q3. What new things have you learnt about meditation?
        </p>

        <p>
        I like the idea of combating in a state of mediation the negative voice that says that you are in meditation with a voice of self kindness. I think that the pulling back to attention after distraction is the difficult and productive zone to develop in.
        </p>

        <p>
        Q4. Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?
        </p>

        <p>
        I think the idea of sitting like a mountain, having a voice of self kindness in meditation and returning to attention after distraction.
        </p>

        <p>
        Q5. Any other musings?
        </p>

        <p>
        In working through these new challenges I imagine myself almost like a boat in rough seas. To get across the sea I can’t push my engine hard and consistently - sometimes I must be rapid, sometimes I must be slow. Sometimes I am charging up a wave and if I go too hard I’ve capsize. I feel like I am getting better at steering this boat through the multiplicity of conditions I am moving through
