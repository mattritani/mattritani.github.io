        Read or watch chapter 3 of Search Inside Yourself, and reflect:
        </p>

        <p>
        Q1. What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'?
        </p>

        <p>
      When you and your partner are present communication is more effective and meaningful. I found that I was less prone to a kind of imposter syndrome situation where I want to speak as an expert. I felt more open as a learner and felt more ok asking dumb questions. But questions that were important for me to ask to better understand what I was doing.
        </p>

        <p>
        Q2. How did the other person find it?
        </p>

        <p>
      My conversation partner I think enjoyed it. We felt like we were on a more even playing field. Perhaps not a playing field, more two people trying to solve a problem together. It felt more genuine.
        </p>

        <p>
        Q3.  Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?
        </p>

        <p>
        Walking meditation will work well for me. I have found myself hitting roadblocks. When I get stuck and I just do a circumnavigate around the EDA block and come back to the problem. Most of the time it works. Mindful conversations is important. Learning to be more authentic in interactions builds meaningful relationships. These two will work for me. It’s quite easy to assign time that should be going to meditation to other things. To be 'too busy' to quiet your mind. But it’s important and I am learning that more and more. One of the most useful things I’ve found is just acknowledging emotion. It’s like an email arrives and you have this rush of anxiety. What I can do now is say - 'I’m having a rush of anxiety because some external stimulus has done something'. What I think I can do now is say - well I’m feeling this. It doesn’t change the feeling much but at least I can look at it objectively analyse it in a sensible way.
        </p>

        <p>
        Q4. Any other musings?
        </p>

        <p>
        Notice and acknowledge your internal chatter. It’s ok to have it. You just have to make sure that chatter doesn’t override your life. It’s your happiness at stake you know.
