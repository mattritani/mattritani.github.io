              Q1 What is grid based design?

        </p>
        <p><p class ="body">
              Grid based design is a system for designing website that allows for a flexible and consistent display of content across the website. Given that Websites are made up of many many boxes grid based design is a means to organise these boxes in a way the is both beautiful and legible to a person engaging with the screen. It is based around our ability to perceive patterns and aligns with how we best understand information - for instance reading from left to right within english written language. It is a logic behind a visual organisation system.

              Q2 Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?

        </p>
        <p><p class ="body">
          I think the hype is justified. Responsive webpages are pages that can engage with a whole range of ways of interfacing with the site. So they change according to how you are engaging with them and the size of the screen that you are engaging with. Mobile is a good example that is shows the information in the right way for the device that you are viewing it on.

            Q3 What is semantic structure?

        </p>
        <p><p class ="body">
              Semantic structure is a way of breaking down information using different stylings from your CSS. For instance an H1 heading should be more impactful and visually important than H4. Semantic structure helps to define what is the most and least importance features on the webpage and displays them accordingly.

              Q4 Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on?

        </p>
        <p><p class ="body">
          I found that getting the layouts of the boxes to work and the writing of the CSS to describe this a bit of a nightmare. I wasn’t very successful and felt that I couldn’t control the layout very well. This is something I want to get better at as it seems that it is foundational to the code-test-review process.
