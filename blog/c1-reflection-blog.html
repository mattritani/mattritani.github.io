      <p>
      What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?

       There is a strong focus on emotional intelligence. I agree and value emotional intelligence its something that we can all work on. I like that it opposes some of the more damaging aspects of the western education system. I’ve yet to experience the proposed emotional intelligence practices, it’s important that it is an appropriate amount? I would hit a law of diminishing returns of how chilled out I am vs how many downward dogs I do. What is my perfect number of downward dogs? The approach of focussing on human interaction and relationship in the workplace is key and something I can learn from.

      What are your impressions?

      The working space is pleasant. You can tell the level of anxiety in a room by it’s ‘vibe’. The vibe is nicer than other places I have been. EDA values optimism, creativity and innovation. This is something I appreciate. I like the values around ‘if I can see a better way of doing something I’ll have a tinker and give it a go’

      How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?

      I think I will enjoy the culture. The big challenge is being vulnerable. This is an environment that will be a good place to be vulnerable. There are different ways to contribute to this culture and I am sure I will find ways to do this that will resonate.
      Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?
      My expectations have not changed but I have a fuller picture of what it is now.

      Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
      I am;
      1. excited
      2. nervous
      3. wondering if doing this is a good idea
      4. wondering if doing this is a terrible idea
      5. happy
      6. trepidatious
      7. fidgety
      8. thrilled.

      All the feelings
