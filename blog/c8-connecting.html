          Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?

I think the connection between self awareness and empathy is quite clear when you consider it. They both require an open and un-judgemental viewing of emotions. I think the assumption that all people are reasonable and want to do the right thing and want to be free of pain is important. I think when you say it - you think it would be self evident but I think it’s an important thing to stress and focus on. I was particularly drawn to the item on the how it’s easier to empathize with people of the same race and political views as yourself and it reminded me that to be open and empathetic to everyone is a practice and that we all carry bias in one form or another. It is important that we engage with this and do the work to shift our thinking. I believe in trust and bringing one’s full self to work. I think if I was in more of a managerial role I would begin with a session of ‘breaking bread’ where people would meet for a meal but would have to make the meal together and do the dishes afterward. I fundamentally believe in the sharing of food for all cultures is a starting point for conversation. Real empathy is built when the cameras are not on y’know.

Try empathic listening - how did it go?
        </p>

        <p>
          I have tried empathetic listening and it’s difficult as it requires you to break your normal habits in regard to thinking when in conversation. I think I’m definitely guilty of not being fully present in conversation but like mindfulness and mediation it requires greater concentration and mental control - which is a journey we are all moving through. I will endeavour to try it more.

How did you find the loving kindness meditation?
        </p>

        <p>
    I found it good. I think I sometimes forget to approach situations and people in a open and warm way. I think sometimes I set expectations of others, a situation and myself based on a rapid firm analysis and research of what i know.  I consider myself to be quite shrewd and perceptive but I think this needs to be done in combination with an open desire to understand how things are.

          Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.

There was a period where a contractor was trying to charge for engineering work that was within their contracted scope but the additional detail required for the specific situation was inadequate to resolve the problem. The design team and project managers had not been delivering information as fast as the contractor needed. The relationship was a bit fraught at times.

We have been working on this programme and the consultants have been pretty useless the documentation has been crap and the whole process has been quite messy for a while. The conditions we are working in are difficult and we have already put in an extension of time. Although we should make some money off the project we want to keep the relationship with the client and save face for our company. We’ve got the engineer in and although contractually I understand in some senses you must be taking the piss. We both want to get this resolved quickly.Reframing it through another's eyes is a helpful exercise.
